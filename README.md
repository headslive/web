heads' web repo
===============

This is the git repository of the [heads.dyne.org](https://heads.dyne.org)
website. Nothing less, nothing more.

The pages you want to generate have to be in markdown format, with a .html.md
extension. To generate them, just type `make`. The markdown parser I like to
use is [smu](https://github.com/Gottox/smu).

Edit `config.mk` for any configuration you might need.
