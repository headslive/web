heads downloads
===============

heads is released on a quarterly basis, meaning every three months you
can expect a new release of heads. While the previous versions are kept
for archiving purposes, you are always advised to use the latest version
since it probably contains bugfixes and more features than the previous
version.

If you wish to help and host a mirror of the heads pub repository,
please email us at [heads@dyne.org](mailto:heads@dyne.org).
