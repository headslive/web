heads downloads
===============

heads is released on a when-ready basis, meaning when things are ready
and relatively stable, you can expect a new release of heads. You are
always advised to use the latest version since it probably contains
bugfixes and more features than the previous versions. In case of
emergencies and/or vulnerabilities, a patch release can be made and
will be announced.

All releases and their SHA256 sums are signed with my gpg key:
