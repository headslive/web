a wish for a fish
=================

heads also has a wishlist!

Currently needed are ARM boards for testing and development. The boards that are
usable have to have at least video and networking support in mainline Linux,
blob-free.

Some examples of the machines that you can donate:

* Asus C201 Chromebook
* Olimex OLinuXino A20 Lime2
* Samsung Chromebook XE303C12
* HP Chromebook 11

If you want to donate this or some other hardware, please email
