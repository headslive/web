First announcement of heads
===========================

[dyne.org](https://www.dyne.org) is proud to announce the new,
soon-to-be-released GNU/Linux distribution called **heads**, as you
might already see from the website's name :p

heads is a new libre (free as in freedom) GNU/Linux distribution born
out as an answer to Tails 2.0 and their switch to the systemd init
system. Keep in mind not only systemd is the reason. Tails is also a
distribution that doesn't respect users' freedom and offers non-free
software. Advertising such a distribution as the world's main choice
for a distro that respects your privacy is pure bullshit. Non-free
software **can not be audited** for security without reverse engineering
such software. It is very hard to do so, and without proper motivation,
nobody is going to do it.

As an answer to this problem, we decided to create **heads**. Mentioned
already, heads respects your freedom: by offering **only free software**.

For a more in-depth explanation on heads, see the [about](/about.html)
page.
