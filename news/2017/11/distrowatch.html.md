heads hit distrowatch
=====================

Seems legit.

heads is a real distro now, as it's featured on distrowatch. The page
can be found on
[https://distrowatch.com/heads](https://distrowatch.com/heads). Shill,
give bad reviews, do whatever, but know that I will haunt you if you
treat it bad :p

This should've been a tweet...


**P.S.**
We also have a [wishlist](/wishlist.html) now. I'm mostly looking for
well-supported ARM hardware (and Chromebooks) so I can start testing
heads ARM builds. Getting at least one good Chromebook would mean a lot
for enabling heads on ARM. Thanks!
