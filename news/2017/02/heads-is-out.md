##+TITLE heads is out! :: heads

heads 0.0 is out!
=================

It finally happened and it's not vaporware!

heads 0.0 is a preview live CD of what heads is going to be about. This
release is not intended to be used from a security point of view, but
as a showcase and testing point of view.

I am not even completely sure everything is torified, but hey, that's
what testing is for, no?

So please, download the ISO from the downloads link in the above navbar
and abuse the hell out of it :)

Throughout a certain period, bugs will be fixed within the build
system, and patched releases will be released without announcement. So
check regularly for 0.0.x releases on the downloads page...

But first, read some notes on it all:

Booting the ISO can be done with some virtualization like qemu or
VirtualBox, or it can be dd-ed to a USB flash drive and booted on a
laptop. It can be burned to optical media as well.

The MATE desktop environment is not yet included in this release, but
only AwesomeWM. You will automatically be logged in to the graphical
environment.

## Bugs. Lots of bugs.

## Feature requests
Possible in the form of issues on the bugtracker, but probably won't
be accepted.

## Collaboration requests

Absolutely welcome.

## Quick questions, socialization, {on,off}topic
