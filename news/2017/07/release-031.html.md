heads 0.3.1 bugfix release
==========================

With fixes to Xorg and security updates

This release does not bring any significant features, but comes with an
optional way to start the graphical interface using `startawesome` or
`startopenbox`. There were some troubles with autostarting X since we
got rid of ConsoleKit/PolicyKit so we will be requiring for X to be
started manually for the time being.
