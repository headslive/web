heads repositories have migrated
================================

Just a heads up, I've migrated heads' git repositories and the
bugtracker to github today. The gitlab instance at git.devuan.org has
not been performing on par lately and I've had issues using it when
pushing git commits...

So heads now lives at github for the time being:
[github.com/headslive](https://github.com/headslive/)

Thank you for understanding.
