frequent annoying questions
===========================

### <a class="anchor" id="login"></a> What are the login credentials?

luther:luther


### <a class="anchor" id="typo"></a> Why is it _heads_ and not _Heads_?

So you can ask an annoying question.


### <a class="anchor" id="branding"></a> Why is there no branding, logos, etc. in the OS?

heads is intended as a distro for privacy-aware people. You don't want
to go out with a system screaming "Hey, I'm using heads!!!". So an
elegant and lean looking solution is there in the form of dark colours
and a lovely wallpaper.


### <a class="anchor" id="where-to-get-help"></a> Where do I get help for using heads?

Please don't ask for help on the bugtracker. You can get help and talk
with other heads users via [IRC](/irc.html), and via the
[mailing list](https://mailinglists.dyne.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/heads).


### <a class="anchor" id="how-to-donate"></a> How do I donate?

See [contributing](/contribute.html).


### <a class="anchor" id="similar-to-heads"></a> Are there any projects similar to heads?

Of course! Decentralization is key :)

Here's a few notable projects, both privacy-wise and/or security-wise:

* [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/)
* [Tails](https://tails.boum.org)
* [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/)
* [Subgraph OS](https://subgraph.com/sgos/)

### <a class="anchor" id="i-found-a-bug"></a> I found a bug! What do I do?

Go to [heads' bugtracker](https://git.devuan.org/heads/bugtracker/issues)
and search through the issues. If your bug isn't already reported, open
a new issue and try to explain it the best you can.


### <a class="anchor" id="why-isnt-foo-here"></a> Why is _foo_ not in heads?

The distro is very fresh. I am getting feedback as people are giving it.
Feel free to open a feature request on the
[bugtracker](https://git.devuan.org/heads/bugtracker/issues), and tag it
with **feature request**.


### <a class="anchor" id="how-do-i-update-heads"></a> How do I update heads?

First check you are running the latest version of heads. The version you
have should be the same as it is on the [downloads page](/download/). If
that is the case, you can issue `heads-update` from within the system to
see if there are any minor system updates. If however, you don't have
the latest ISO, just grab that :)


### <a class="anchor" id="it-says-no-permissions"></a> It says I don't have permissions?

Execute it as `root`.


### <a class="anchor" id="what-is-the-root-password"></a> What is the root password?

You saw it on the login screen. It is only shown once when you login
and then it disappears (as it told you).
