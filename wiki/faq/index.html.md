frequent annoying questions
===========================

### What are the login credentials? <a id="login" href="#login"><img src="/static/anchor.svg" class="anchor" alt="•"></a>

root:toor

luther:luther


### Why is it _heads_ and not _Heads_? <a id="typo" href="#typo"><img src="/static/anchor.svg" class="anchor" alt="•"></a>

Because I said so.


### Why is there no branding, logos, etc. in the OS? <a id="branding" href="#branding"><img src="/static/anchor.svg" class="anchor" alt="•"></a>

heads is intended as a distro for privacy-aware people. You don't want
to go out with a system screaming "Hey, I'm using heads!!!". So an
elegant and lean looking solution is there in the form of dark colours
and a lovely wallpaper.


### Where do I get help for using heads? <a id="where-to-get-help" href="#where-to-get-help"><img src="/static/anchor.svg" class="anchor" alt="•"></a>

Please don't ask for help on the bugtracker. You can get help and talk
with other heads users via [IRC](/irc.html), and via the [mailing
list](https://mailinglists.dyne.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/heads).


### How do I donate? <a id="how-to-donate" href="#how-to-donate"><img src="/static/anchor.svg" class="anchor" alt="•"></a>

See [contributing](/contribute.html) and the [wishlist](/wishlist.html).


### Are there any projects similar to heads? <a id="similar-to-heads" href="#similar-to-heads"><img src="/static/anchor.svg" class="anchor" alt="•"></a>

Of course! Decentralization is key :)

Here's a few notable projects, both privacy-wise and/or security-wise:

* [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/)
* [Gentoo Hardened](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Hardened/)
* [Qubes](https://www.qubes-os.org/)
* [Subgraph OS](https://subgraph.com/sgos/)
* [Tails](https://tails.boum.org)
* [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/)


### I found a bug! What do I do? <a id="i-found-a-bug" href="#i-found-a-bug"><img src="/static/anchor.svg" class="anchor" alt="•"></a>

Go to [heads'
bugtracker](https://github.com/headslive/bugtracker/issues) and search
through the issues. If your bug isn't already reported, open a new issue
and try to explain it the best you can.

The most prefered way to report bugs is by submitting patches.


### Why is _foo_ not in heads? <a id="why-isnt-foo-here" href="#why-isnt-foo-here"><img src="/static/anchor.svg" class="anchor" alt="•"></a>

The distro is very fresh. I am getting feedback as people are giving it.
Feel free to open a feature request on the
[bugtracker](https://github.com/headslive/bugtracker/issues), and tag it
with **feature request**.


### How do I update heads? <a id="how-do-i-update-heads" href="#how-do-i-update-heads"><img src="/static/anchor.svg" class="anchor" alt="•"></a>

First check you are running the latest version of heads. The version you
have should be the same as it is on the [downloads page](/download/). If
that is the case, you can issue `sudo heads-update` from within the
system to see if there are any minor system updates. However, if you
don't have the latest ISO, just grab that :)


### What is the root password? <a id="what-is-the-root-password" href="#what-is-the-root-password"><img src="/static/anchor.svg" class="anchor" alt="•"></a>

You saw it upon booting, on the welcome screens. It is only shown here
at this time and then it disappears (as it told you).
