frequent annoying questions
===========================

### <a id="login" href="#login"><img src="/static/anchor.svg" class="anchor"></a> What are the login credentials?

root:toor

luther:luther


### <a id="typo" href="#typo"><img src="/static/anchor.svg" class="anchor"></a> Why is it _heads_ and not _Heads_?

So you can ask an annoying question.


### <a id="branding" href="#branding"><img src="/static/anchor.svg" class="anchor"></a> Why is there no branding, logos, etc. in the OS?

heads is intended as a distro for privacy-aware people. You don't want
to go out with a system screaming "Hey, I'm using heads!!!". So an
elegant and lean looking solution is there in the form of dark colours
and a lovely wallpaper.


### <a id="where-to-get-help" href="#where-to-get-help"><img src="/static/anchor.svg" class="anchor"></a> Where do I get help for using heads?

Please don't ask for help on the bugtracker. You can get help and talk
with other heads users via [IRC](/irc.html), and via the
[mailing list](https://mailinglists.dyne.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/heads).

### <a id="i-found-a-bug" href="#i-found-a-bug"><img src="/static/anchor.svg" class="anchor"></a> I found a bug! What do I do?

Go to [heads' bugtracker](https://github.com/headslive/bugtracker/issues)
and search through the issues. If your bug isn't already reported, open
a new issue and try to explain it the best you can.


### <a id="why-isnt-foo-here" href="#why-isnt-foo-here"><img src="/static/anchor.svg" class="anchor"></a> Why is _foo_ not in heads?

The distro is very fresh. I am getting feedback as people are giving it.
Feel free to open a feature request on the
[bugtracker](https://github.com/headslive/bugtracker/issues), and tag it
with **feature request**.


### <a id="how-do-i-update-heads" href="#how-do-i-update-heads"><img src="/static/anchor.svg" class="anchor"></a> How do I update heads?

First check you are running the latest version of heads. The version you
have should be the same as it is on the [downloads page](/download/). If
that is the case, you can issue `sudo heads-update` from within the system
to see if there are any minor system updates. However, if you don't have
the latest ISO, just grab that :)


### <a id="what-is-the-root-password" href="#what-is-the-root-password"><img src="/static/anchor.svg" class="anchor"></a> What is the root password?

You saw it when you opened a terminal for the first time in the session.
It is only shown once at this time and then it disappears (as it told
you).
